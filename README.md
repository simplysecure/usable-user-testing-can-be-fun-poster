# 'Usertesting can be fun: An FAQ' poster version

User testing can be fun is the first resource of five created by the team at [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/) for OSS tool teams about design.

USABLE resources focus on supporting maintainers of OSS, developer contributors and OSS tool teams to better understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.

USABLE is a collaboration between [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/), [Okthanks](https://okthanks.com/) and [Internews](https://internews.org/) looking to build resources for OSS tool teams to help them understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.

Unlike a repository of code ([like the interactive guide has here](https://github.com/simplysecure/usable-user-testing-can-be-fun)) where you can fork, clone, edit, play and submit improvements via issues and PR's to the games code the poster version can be iterated on and collaborated on in a similar way through using an open ['PenPot'](https://penpot.app/) file and then through uploading a 'finished' version of your remixed poster via a pull request to our [repository for the 'Usertesting can be fun: An FAQ' poster](https://github.com/simplysecure/usable-user-testing-can-be-fun-poster).

You can find our poster in a [PenPot 'shared prototype' here](https://design.penpot.app/#/view/5ac34dd0-8da2-11ec-a2fe-9eafb5cb1e0f?page-id=5ac34dd1-8da2-11ec-a2fe-9eafb5cb1e0f&section=interactions&index=0&share-id=7163d870-8da2-11ec-a2fe-9eafb5cb1e0f).

You can fork this repo and make changes to the game and use any of the images and content here - it's free and open source :)
